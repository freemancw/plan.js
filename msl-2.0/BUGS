For some reason, the correct NumNodes is not getting used
in fdp.C.  Only the base class value gets used.  

The Performer renderer has some problems compiling that seem to
occur because of conflicts caused by compiler options required
by other libraries.  Better makefiles should solve this.

Segmentation faults if planner is switched from the menu on
some platforms.  I can't reproduce it...

The animation sticks on some platforms.  One has to the jiggle
the mouse to get the frames to advance.

There are no intermediate frames shown for the PRM planner 
solutions.  The frames jump from vertex to vertex.
