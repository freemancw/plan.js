class {\bf RCRRT}
\begin{CompactList}\small\item\em Resolution Complete Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees , by Peng Cheng and Steven M. La\-Valle, submitted to 2002 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation. Techniques applied to improve the performance: (1) Combining systematic search with random search such that it has both the completeness of the systematic search and fast searching of the random search. (2) Constraint violation tendency to avoid obstacles This basic planner is used to do the experiment with dynamic car model in the virtual town. The rolling effect of the car and the nonlinear tire model are considered in the model.\item\end{CompactList}\item 
class {\bf RCRRTBall}
\begin{CompactList}\small\item\em {\bf RCRRT} {\rm (p.\,\pageref{classRCRRT})} planner using ball neighborhood to exclude the repeated states.\item\end{CompactList}\item 
class {\bf RCRRTBall\-Dual}
\begin{CompactList}\small\item\em Basic dual tree version of {\bf RCRRTBall} {\rm (p.\,\pageref{classRCRRTBall})}.\item\end{CompactList}\item 
class {\bf RCRRTBall\-Ext\-Ext}
\begin{CompactList}\small\item\em Dual tree version of {\bf RCRRTBall} {\rm (p.\,\pageref{classRCRRTBall})} with Ext\-Ext method.\item\end{CompactList}\item 
class {\bf RCRRTDual}
\begin{CompactList}\small\item\em Basic dual tree version of {\bf RCRRT} {\rm (p.\,\pageref{classRCRRT})}.\item\end{CompactList}\item 
class {\bf RCRRTExt\-Ext}
\begin{CompactList}\small\item\em Dual tree version of {\bf RCRRT} {\rm (p.\,\pageref{classRCRRT})} with Ext\-Ext method, which is used to do experiments with spacecraft model in 3D grid environment considering the dynamic constraints .\item\end{CompactList}\end{CompactItemize}
